# PetrolNotification
Python project that is hosted on PythonAnywhere as a daily task to notify users when fuel prices are at cyclic lows. The program leverages emerging AI tech through
the OpenAI API to condense a buying tip from the ACCC. The price is calculated as the 5th percentile value for all prices in Adelaide. The notification is sent
using the Pushover API.
